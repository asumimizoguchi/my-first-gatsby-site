A traditional Victoria sponge cake, perfect for any afternoon with a cup of tea.

### Recipe instruction

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F/180°C and grease two 8 inch cake tins.

2. In a large bowl, mix the butter and sugar together, then add the eggs, flour and baking powder.

3. Spread the mix evenly between the 2 cake tins.

4. Place both tins in the middle of the preheated oven for 20 minutes, before checking with a knife. When the knife comes out clean, it's ready!

5. Allow to cool in the tins before moving them onto a cooling rack.

6. Add the jam, stack, dust with icing sugar and serve with a big dollop of cream. Enjoy!
